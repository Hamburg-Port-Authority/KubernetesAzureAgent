Kubernetes Azure Agent
====

This agent is heavly inspired by the [official guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/docker?view=azure-devops) from microsoft. 
The script located inside the */src/docker/azure-scripts* folder are extracted from this. 

The purpose of this docker image is to extend it with required tools for kubernetes operations in a on-premise environment with limited access towards the world wide web.
